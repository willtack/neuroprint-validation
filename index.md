**Design and Instructions**

In the study, you will view images and make forced choice diagnostic decisions in 60 patients comprising healthy controls (n=) as well as clinically diagnosed AD (n=) and FTD (n=) patients. You will first decide if the presented case is normal or abnormal and, if abnormal, choose among overarching disease categories (AD, FTDC, other), then among several potential subtypes depending on the choice of disease category, like so:

- Level 1: Normal vs Abnormal
- Level 2: If Abnormal, AD Spectrum vs. FTD Spectrum vs. Other Neurodegenerative
- Level 3: Additional subtype (e.g. logopenic PPA): Free text

The rater will also rate their confidence in their answer for Levels 1 and 2 as being 1) a guess, 2) low, 3) high.

The images will be unlabeled and will vary in order from stage to stage.

The study is divided into four stages:

1. Raters view raw T1w images and make diagnosis
2. Orientation: Raters view Neuroprint heatmaps but make no diagnosis.
3. Raters view Neuroprint heatmaps and make diagnosis
4. Raters view Neuroprint heatmaps alongside clinical context for that case and make diagnosis
